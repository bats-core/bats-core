Welcome to bats-core's documentation!
=====================================

Bats (Bash Automated Testing System) is a `TAP <https://testanything.org/>`_-compliant testing framework for Bash 3.2 or above. It provides a simple way to verify that the UNIX programs you write behave as expected.

Bats is most useful when testing software written in Bash, but you can use it to test any UNIX program.

Versions before v1.2.1 are documented over in `docs/versions.md <https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core/blob/master/docs/versions.md>`_.
