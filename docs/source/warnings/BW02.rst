BW02: <feature> requires at least BATS_VERSION=<version>. Use `bats_require_minimum_version <version>` to fix this message.
===========================================================================================================================

Using a feature that is only available starting with a certain version can be a problem when your tests also run on older versions of Bats.
In most cases, running this code in older versions will generate an error due to a missing command.
However, in cases like `run`'s where old version simply take all parameters as command to execute, the failure can be silent.

How to fix
----------

When you encounter this warning, you can simply guard your code with `bats_require_minimum_version <version>` as the message says.
For example, consider the following code:

.. code-block:: bash

    @test test {
        bats_require_minimum_version 1.5.0
        # pre 1.5.0 the flag --separate-stderr would be interpreted as command to run
        run --separate-stderr some-command 
        [ $output = "blablabla" ]
    }


The call to `bats_require_minimum_version` can be put anywhere before the warning generating command, even in `setup`, `setup_file`, or even outside any function.
This can be used to give fine control over the version dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    @test test {
        bats_require_minimum_version 1.5.0
        # pre 1.5.0 the flag --separate-stderr would be interpreted as command to run
        run --separate-stderr some-command 
        [ $output = "blablabla" ]
    }

    @test test2 {
        run some-other-command # no problem executing on earlier version
    }


If the above code is executed on a system with a `BATS_VERSION` pre 1.5.0, the first test will fail on `bats_require_minimum_version 1.5.0`.

Instances:
----------

- run's non command parameters like `--keep-empty-lines` are only available since 1.5.0
