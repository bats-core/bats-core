    details and how to find out if your tests are affected.

## [1.1.0] - 2018-07-08

This is the first release with new features relative to the original Bats 0.4.0.

### Added

* The `-r, --recursive` flag to scan directory arguments recursively for
  `*.bats` files (#109)
* The `contrib/rpm/bats.spec` file to build RPMs (#111)

### Changed

* Travis exercises latest versions of Bash from 3.2 through 4.4 (#116, #117)
* Error output highlights invalid command line options (#45, #46, #118)
* Replaced `echo` with `printf` (#120)

### Fixed

* Fixed `BATS_ERROR_STATUS` getting lost when `bats_error_trap` fired multiple
  times under Bash 4.2.x (#110)
* Updated `bin/bats` symlink resolution, handling the case on CentOS where
  `/bin` is a symlink to `/usr/bin` (#113, #115)

## [1.0.2] - 2018-06-18

* Fixed sstephenson/bats#240, whereby `skip` messages containing parentheses
  were truncated (#48)
* Doc improvements:
  * Docker usage (#94)
  * Better README badges (#101)
  * Better installation instructions (#102, #104)
* Packaging/installation improvements:
  * package.json update (#100)
  * Moved `libexec/` files to `libexec/bats-core/`, improved `install.sh` (#105)

## [1.0.1] - 2018-06-09

* Fixed a `BATS_CWD` bug introduced in #91 whereby it was set to the parent of
  `PWD`, when it should've been set to `PWD` itself (#98). This caused file
  names in stack traces to contain the basename of `PWD` as a prefix, when the
  names should've been purely relative to `PWD`.
* Ensure the last line of test output prints when it doesn't end with a newline
  (#99). This was a quasi-bug introduced by replacing `sed` with `while` in #88.

## [1.0.0] - 2018-06-08

`1.0.0` generally preserves compatibility with `0.4.0`, but with some Bash
compatibility improvements and a massive performance boost. In other words:

* all existing tests should remain compatible
* tests that might've failed or exhibited unexpected behavior on earlier
  versions of Bash should now also pass or behave as expected

Changes:

* Added support for Docker.
* Added support for test scripts that have the [unofficial strict
  mode](http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/) enabled.
* Improved stability on Windows and macOS platforms.
* Massive performance improvements, especially on Windows (#8)
* Workarounds for inconsistent behavior between Bash versions (#82)
* Workaround for preserving stack info after calling an exported function under
  Bash < 4.4 (#87)
* Fixed TAP compliance for skipped tests
* Added support for tabs in test names.
* `bin/bats` and `install.sh` now work reliably on Windows (#91)

## [0.4.0] - 2014-08-13

* Improved the display of failing test cases. Bats now shows the source code of
  failing test lines, along with full stack traces including function names,
  filenames, and line numbers.
* Improved the display of the pretty-printed test summary line to include the
  number of skipped tests, if any.
* Improved the speed of the preprocessor, dramatically shortening test and suite
  startup times.
* Added support for absolute pathnames to the `load` helper.
* Added support for single-line `@test` definitions.
* Added bats(1) and bats(7) manual pages.
* Modified the `bats` command to default to TAP output when the `$CI` variable
  is set, to better support environments such as Travis CI.

## [0.3.1] - 2013-10-28

* Fixed an incompatibility with the pretty formatter in certain environments
  such as tmux.
* Fixed a bug where the pretty formatter would crash if the first line of a test
  file's output was invalid TAP.

## [0.3.0] - 2013-10-21

* Improved formatting for tests run from a terminal. Failing tests are now
  colored in red, and the total number of failing tests is displayed at the end
  of the test run. When Bats is not connected to a terminal (e.g. in CI runs),
  or when invoked with the `--tap` flag, output is displayed in standard TAP
  format.
* Added the ability to skip tests using the `skip` command.
* Added a message to failing test case output indicating the file and line
  number of the statement that caused the test to fail.
* Added "ad-hoc" test suite support. You can now invoke `bats` with multiple
  filename or directory arguments to run all the specified tests in aggregate.
* Added support for test files with Windows line endings.
* Fixed regular expression warnings from certain versions of Bash.
* Fixed a bug running tests containing lines that begin with `-e`.

## [0.2.0] - 2012-11-16

* Added test suite support. The `bats` command accepts a directory name
  containing multiple test files to be run in aggregate.
* Added the ability to count the number of test cases in a file or suite by
  passing the `-c` flag to `bats`.
* Preprocessed sources are cached between test case runs in the same file for
  better performance.

## [0.1.0] - 2011-12-30

* Initial public release.
